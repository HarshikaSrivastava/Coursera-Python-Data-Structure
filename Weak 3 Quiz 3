Given the architecture and terminology we introduced in Chapter 1, where are files stored?Central Processor
Motherboard
Secondary memory
Main Memory

What is stored in a "file handle" that is returned from a successful open() call?


The handle contains the first 10 lines of a file


The handle is a connection to the file's data


All the data from the file is read into memory and stored in the handle


The handle has a list of all of the files in a particular folder on the hard drive
What do we use the second parameter of the open() call to indicate?
How large we expect the file to be
The list of folders to be searched to find the file we want to open
Whether we want to read data from the file or write data to the file

What disk drive the file is stored on
What Python function would you use if you wanted to prompt the user for a file name to open?


input()
file_input()
alert()
gets()

What is the purpose of the newline character in text files?
It adds a new network connection to retrieve files from the network
It enables random movement throughout the file
It indicates the end of one line of text and the beginning of another line of text
It allows us to open more than one files and read them in a synchronized manner

What is the purpose of the following Python code?
Reverse the order of the lines in mbox.txt
Remove the leading and trailing spaces from each line in mbox.txt
Count the lines in the file 'mbox.txt'
Convert the lines in mbox.txt to upper case

If you write a Python program to read a text file and you see extra blank lines in the output that are not present in the file input as shown below, what Python string function will likely solve the problem?
startswith()
ljust()
find()
rstrip()

The following code sequence fails with a traceback when the user enters a file that does not exist. How would you avoid the traceback and make it so you could print out your own error message when a bad file name was entered?
begin / rescue / end
on error resume next
try / except
setjmp / longjmp

What does the following Python code do?
Prompts the user for a file name
Turns the text in the file into a graphic image like a PNG or JPG
Reads the entire file into the variable inp as a string


Checks to see if the file exists and can be written
